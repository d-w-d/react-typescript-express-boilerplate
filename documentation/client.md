# Client Code

The client code is built in react with typescript. For component library, we're using MaterialUI. The boilerplate adapts the [responsive-drawer](https://material-ui.com/components/drawers/#responsive-drawer) layout.

The client is a fully responsive PWA.

The code and assets are transpiled and bundled using webpack. The build supports css, scss and elss styles (global and css modules), though this repo mainly uses the css-in-js solution provided by MaterialUI. State management is handled with react context.
